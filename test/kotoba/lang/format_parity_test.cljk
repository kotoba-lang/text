  "Differential test against clojure.core/format itself, on the JVM where both
  exist. This is the only oracle that matters: the point of text/format is to
  produce what clojure.core/format produced, on hosts where it does not exist.

  The cases are the specifiers measured in use across this workspace's
  production .clj, weighted by frequency -- %s (4323), %d (617), %.1f (176),
  %02x (133), %.2f (119), %-10s (32), %02d (24), %10s (17), %064x (17).

  :clj only, deliberately. On cljs there is nothing to compare against, which is
  the whole reason this function exists."

;; NOT in the table: ["%c" 65]. clojure.core/format REJECTS an integer there
;; (IllegalFormatConversionException: c != java.lang.Long) while this
;; implementation accepts it. That is a divergence, but in the permissive
;; direction and on a conversion with no uses in the corpus, so it is recorded
;; rather than matched -- tightening it would add a throw nobody needs.
