  "Parity between this namespace's self-hosted implementations and
  `clojure.string`, over a corpus rather than a handful of examples.

  Since kotoba.lang.text stopped delegating, `clojure.string` is no longer a
  dependency -- it is the ORACLE. That is the only reason it is required here.
  These tests are what makes the claim \"same semantics, no dependency\"
  checkable instead of asserted.

  Inputs on which clojure.string deliberately disagrees with itself across
  hosts are NOT in the parity corpus; they are pinned separately below with
  the answer this namespace gives on every host."
